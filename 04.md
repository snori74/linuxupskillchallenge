# Day 4 - Installing software, exploring the file structure

## INTRO

As a sysadmin, one of your key tasks is to install new software as required. You’ll also need to be very familiar with the layout of the standard directories in a Linux system.

You’ll be getting practice in both of these areas in today’s session.

## Your tasks today

* Install a new application from the online repositories 
* Become familiar with some of the standard directories
* Look at the format and content of some configuration files.

If you've used a smartphone "app store " or "market", then you'll immediately understand the normal installation of Linux software from the standard repositories. As long as we know what the name or description of a package (=app) is, then we  can search for it:

     apt search "midnight commander"

This will show a range of matching "packages", and we can then install them with `apt install` command. So to install package `mc` (Midnight Commander) on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install mc
```

(Unless you're already logged in as the `root` user you need to use `sudo` before the installation commands - because an ordinary user is not permitted to install software that could impact a whole server).

Now that you have `mc` installed, start it by simply typing `mc` and pressing *Enter*.

This isn't a "classic" Unix application, but once you get over the retro interface you should find navigation fairly easy, so go looking for these directories:

`/root`  
`/home`  
`/sbin`  
`/etc`  
`/var/log`  

...and use the links in the Resources section below to begin to understand how these are used. You can also read the official manual on this hierarchy by typing `man hier`.

Most key configuration files are kept under `/etc` and subdirectories of that. These files, and the logs under `/var/log` are almost invariably simple text files. In the coming days you'll be spending a lot of time with these - but for now simply use F3 to look into their contents.

Some interesting files to look at are: `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and `/var/log/auth.log`

Use F3 again to exit from viewing a file.

F10 will exit `mc`, although you may need to use your mouse to select it.

(On an Apple Mac in Terminal, you may need to use ESC+3 to get F3 and ESC+0 for F10)

Now use `apt search` to search for and install some more packages: Try searching for “hangman”. You will probably find that an old text-based version is included in a package called `bsdgames`. Install and play a couple of rounds...

## Posting your progress

* Post your progress, comments and questions to the forum.

## EXTENSION

* Use `mc` to view `/etc/apt/sources.list` where the actual locations of the repositories are specified. Often these will be “mirror” sites that are closer to your server than the main Ubuntu servers.
* Read [Repositories - CommandLine
](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/CommandLine) for more of the gory details.
