# Day 13 -  Who has permission?

## INTRO

Files on a Linux system always have associated "permissions" - controlling who has access and what sort of access. You'll have bumped into this in various ways already - as an example, yesterday while logged in as your "ordinary" user, you could not upload files directly into _/var/www_ or create a new folder at _/_.

The Linux permission system is quite simple, but it does have some quirky and subtle aspects, so today is simply an introduction to some of the basic concepts.

This time you really _do_ need to work your way through the material in the RESOURCES section!

## OWNERSHIP

First let's look at "ownership". All files are tagged with both the name of the user and the group that owns them, so if we type "ls -l" and see a file listing like this:

	-rw------- 	1 steve  staff  	4478979  6 Feb  2011 private.txt
	-rw-rw-r-- 	1 steve  staff  	4478979  6 Feb  2011 press.txt
	-rwxr-xr-x 	1 steve  staff  	4478979  6 Feb  2011 upload.bin

Then these files are owned by user "steve", and the group "staff".

## PERMISSIONS

Looking at the '-rw-r--r--" at the start of a directory listing line, (ignore the first "-" for now), and see these as potentially three groups of "rwx": the permission granted to the user who owns the file, the "group", and "other people".

For the example list above:

* _private.txt_   - Steve has "rw" (ie Read and Write) permission, but neither the group "staff" nor "other people" have any permission at all
* _press.txt_  - Steve can Read and Write to this file too, but so can any member of the group "staff"  - and _anyone_ can read it
* _upload.bin_  - Steve can write to the file, all others can read it. Additionally all can "execute" the file - ie run this program

You can change the permissions on any file with the `chmod` utility. Create a simple text file in your home directory with `vim` (e.g. _tuesday.txt_) and check that you can list its contents by typing: `cat tuesday.txt` or `less tuesday.txt`.

Now look at its permissions by doing: `ls -ltr tuesday.txt`

	-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu   12 Nov 19 14:48 tuesday.txt

So, the file is owned by the user "ubuntu", and group "ubuntu", who are the only ones that can write to the file - but any other user can read it.

Now let’s remove the permission of the user and "ubuntu" group to write their own file:

`chmod u-w tuesday.txt`

`chmod g-w tuesday.txt`

...and remove the permission for "others" to read the file:

`chmod o-r tuesday.txt`

Do a listing to check the result:

	-r--r----- 1 ubuntu ubuntu   12 Nov 19 14:48 tuesday.txt

...and confirm by trying to edit the file with `nano` or `vim`. You'll find that you appear to be able to edit it - but can't save any changes. (In this case, as the owner, you have "permission to override permissions", so can can write with `:w!`). You can of course easily give yourself back the permission to write to the file by:

`chmod u+w tuesday.txt`

## GROUPS

On most modern Linux systems there is a group created for each user, so user "ubuntu" is a member of the group "ubuntu". However, groups can be added as required, and users added to several groups.

To see what groups you're a member of, simply type: `groups`

On an Ubuntu system the first user created (in your case `ubuntu`), should be a member of the groups: `ubuntu`, `sudo` and `adm` - and if you list the `/var/log` folder you'll see your membership of the `adm` group is why you can use `less` to read and view the contents of `/var/log/auth.log`

The "root" user can add a user to an existing group with the command:

`usermod -a -G group user`

so your `ubuntu` user can do the same simply by prefixing the command with `sudo`. For example, you could add a new user `fred` like this:

`adduser fred`

Because this user is not the first user created, they don't have the power to run `sudo` - which _your_ user has by being a member of the group `sudo`.

So, to check which groups `fred` is a member of, first "become fred" - like this:

`sudo su fred`

Then:

`groups`

Now  type "exit" to return to your normal user, and you can add `fred` to this group with:

`sudo usermod -a -G sudo fred`

And of course, you should then check by "becoming fred" again and running the `groups` command.

## POSTING YOUR PROGRESS

Just for fun, create a file: _secret.txt_ in your home folder, take away all permissions from it for the user, group and others - and see what happens when you try to edit it with `vim`.

## EXTENSION

Research:

* `umask` and test to see how it's setup on your server
* the classic _octal_ mode of describing and setting file permissions. (e.g. `chmod 664 myfile`)

Look into Linux ACLs:
