# Day 8 - the infamous "grep"...

## INTRO

Your server is now running two services: the *sshd* (Secure Shell Daemon) service that you use to login; and the Apache2 web server. Both of these services are generating logs as you and others access your server - and these are text files which we can analyse using some simple tools.

Plain text files are a key part of "the Unix way" and there are many small "tools" to allow you to easily edit, sort, search and otherwise manipulate them. Today we’ll use `grep`, `cat`, `more`, `less`, `cut`, `awk` and `tail` to slice and dice your logs.

The `grep` command is famous for being extremely powerful and handy, but also because its "nerdy" name is typical of Unix/Linux conventions.

## TASKS
* Dump out the complete contents of a file with `cat` like this: `cat /var/log/apache2/access.log`
* Use `less` to open the same file, like this: `less /var/log/apache2/access.log` - and move up and down through the file with your arrow keys, then use “q” to quit.
* Again using `less`, look at a file, but practice confidently moving around using  *gg*, *GG* and */*,  *n* and *p* (to go to the top of the file, bottom of the file, to search for something and to hop to the next "hit" or back to the previous one)
* View recent logins and `sudo` usage by viewing `/var/log/auth.log` with `cat` and `less` 
* Look at just the tail end of the file with `tail /var/log/apache2/access.log` (yes, there's also a `head` command!)
* Follow a log in real-time with: `tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log`  (while accessing your server’s web page in a browser)
* Dump out a file with `cat`, pipe that output to `grep` with a search term - like this: `cat /var/log/auth.log  | grep "authenticating"`
* Simplify this to: `grep "authenticating" /var/log/auth.log`
* Piping the output of one command to another allows you to narrow your search so try something like:  `grep "authenticating" /var/log/auth.log | grep "root"`
* Use the `cut` command to select out most interesting portions of each line by specifying "-d" (delimiter) and "-f" (field) - like: `grep "authenticating" /var/log/auth.log| grep "root"| cut -f 10- -d" "`   (field 10 onwards, where the delimiter between field is the " " character). This approach can be very useful in extracting useful information from log data.
* Use the `-v` option to invert the selection and find attempts to login with other users: `grep "authenticating" /var/log/auth.log| grep -v "root"| cut -f 10- -d" "` 

The output of any command can be "redirected" to a file with the ">" operator. The command: `ls -ltr > listing.txt` wouldn't list the directory contents to your screen, but instead redirect into the file "listing.txt" (creating that file if it didn't exist, or overwriting the contents if it did).

## POSTING YOUR PROGRESS

Re-run the command to list all the IP's that have unsuccessfully tried to login to your server as *root* - but this time, use the the ">" operator to redirect it to the file: `~/attackers.txt`. You might like to share and compare with others doing the course how heavily you're "under attack"!

# EXTENSION

* See if you can extend your filtering of `auth.log` to select just the IP addresses, then pipe this to  `sort`, and then further to `uniq` to get a list of all those IP addresses that have been "auditing" your server security for you.
* Investigate the `awk` and `sed` commands. When you're having difficulty figuring out how to do something with `grep` and `cut`, then you may need to step up to using these. Googling for "linux sed tricks" or "awk one liners" will get you many examples.
* Aim to learn at least one simple useful trick with both `awk` and `sed`
