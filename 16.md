# Day 16 - 'tar' and friends...

## INTRO

As a system administrator, you need to be able to confidently work with compressed “archives” of files. In particular two of your key responsibilities; installing new software, and managing backups, often require this.

## CREATING ARCHIVES

On other operating systems, applications like WinZip, and pkzip before it, have long been used to gather a series of files and folders into one compressed file - with a .zip extension. Linux takes a slightly different approach, with the "gathering" of files and folders done in one step, and the compression in another.

So, you could create a "snapshot" of the current files in your _/etc/init.d_ folder like this:

`tar  -cvf  myinits.tar  /etc/init.d/`

This creates _myinits.tar_ in your current directory.

Note 1: The `-v` switch  (verbose) is included to give some feedback - traditionally many utilities provide no feedback unless they fail.
Note 2: The `-f` switch specifies that _“the output should go to the filename which follows”_ - so in this case the order of the switches is important.

(The cryptic “tar” name? - originally short for "tape archive")

You could then compress this file with GnuZip like this:

`gzip myinits.tar`

...which will create `myinits.tar.gz`. A compressed tar archive like this is known as a "tarball". You will also sometimes see tarballs with a  _.tgz_ extension - at the Linux commandline this doesn't have any meaning to the system, but is simply helpful to humans.

In practice you can do the two steps in one with the "-z" switch, like this:

`tar -cvzf myinits.tgz /etc/init.d/`

This uses the `-c` switch to say that we're creating an archive; `-v` to make the command "verbose"; `-z` to compress the result - and `-f` to specify the output file.

## TASKS FOR TODAY

* Check the links under "Resources" to better understand this - and to find out how to extract files from an archive!
* Use `tar` to create an archive copy of some files and check the resulting size
* Run the same command, but this time use `-z` to compress - and check the file size
* Copy your archives to _/tmp_ (with: `cp`) and extract each there to test that it works


## POSTING YOUR PROGRESS

Nothing to post today - but make sure you understand this stuff, because we'll be using it for real in the next day's session!

## EXTENSION

* What is a .bz2 file - and how would you extract the files from it?
* Research how absolute and relative paths are handled in tar - and why you need to be careful extracting from archives when logged in as root
* You might notice that some tutorials write "tar cvf" rather than "tar -cvf" with the switch character - do you know why?
