# Day 3 - Power trip!

## INTRO
You've been logging in as an ordinary user at your server, yet you're probably aware that `root` is the power user on a Linux system. This administrative or "superuser" account, is all powerful - and a typo in a command could potentially cripple your server. As a sysadmin you're typically working on systems that are both important and remote, so avoiding such mistakes is A Very Good Idea.  

On many older production systems all sysadmins login as “root”, but it’s now common Best Practice to discourage or disallow login directly by `root` - and instead to give specified trusted users the permission to run root-only commands via the `sudo` command. 

This is the way that your server has been set-up, with your “ordinary” login given the ability to run any root-only command  - but only if you precede it with `sudo`. 

(Normally on an Ubuntu system this will ask you to re-confirm your identity with your password.
However, the standard AWS Ubuntu Server image does `not` prompt for a password). 

## YOUR TASKS TODAY:
* Use the links in the "Resources" section below to understand how `sudo` works
* Use `ls -l` to check the permissions of `/etc/shadow` - notice that only `root` has any access. Can you use `cat`, `less` or `nano` to view it?
* This file is where the hashed passwords are kept. It is a prime target for intruders - who aim to grab it and use offline password crackers to discover the passwords.
* Now try with `sudo`, e.g. `sudo less /etc/shadow`
* Test running the `reboot` command, and then via `sudo` (i.e. `sudo reboot`)

Once you've reconnected back:
* Use the `uptime` command to confirm that your server did actually fully restart
* Test fully “becoming root” by the command `sudo -i`  This can be handy if you have a series of commands to do "as root". Note the change to your prompt.
* Type `exit` or `logout` to get back to your own normal “support” login. 
* Use `less` to view the file `/var/log/auth.log`, where any use of `sudo` is logged
* You could "filter" this by typing: `grep "sudo" /var/log/auth.log` 

If you wish to, you can now rename your server, which in Ubuntu is done by editing two files, and then rebooting:

* Edit /etc/hostname using nano text editor, deleting the old name and setting up a new one:

`sudo nano /etc/hostname`
* Then edit the /etc/hosts file, replacing the existing computer name with your new one:

`sudo nano /etc/hosts`
* Reboot the system for changes to take effect:

`sudo reboot`
 
You might also consider changing the timezone your server uses. By default this is likely to be UTC (i.e. GMT) - which is pretty appropriate for a worldwide fleet of servers. You could also set it to the zone the server is in, or where you and your headquarters are. For a company this is a decision not to be taken lightly, but for now you can simply change as you please!

First check the current setting with:

`timedatectl`

Then get a a list of available timezones:

`timedatectl list-timezones`

And finally select one, like this:

`sudo timedatectl set-timezone Australia/Sydney`

Confirm:

`timedatectl`

The major practical effects of this are (1) the timing of scheduled tasks, and (2) the timestamping of the logs files kept under `/var/log`. If you make a change, there will naturally be a "jump" in the dates and time recorded.
 
## WRAP
As a Linux sysadmin you may be working on client or custom systems where you have little control, and many of these will default to doing everything as `root`. You need to be able to safely work on such systems - where your only protection is to double check before pressing `Enter`.

On the other hand, for any systems where you have full control, setting up a "normal" account for yourself (and any co-admins) with permission to run `sudo`  is recommended. While this is standard with Ubuntu, it's also easy to configure with other  popular server distros such as Debian, CentOS and RHEL.
