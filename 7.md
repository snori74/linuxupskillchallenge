#  Day 7 - Installing Apache

## INTRO

Today you'll install a common server application - the Apache2 web server - also known as *httpd* - the "Hyper Text Transport Protocol Daemon"!

If you’re a website professional then you might do things slightly differently, but our focus with this is not on Apache itself, or the website content, but to get a better understanding of:

* application installation
* configuration files
* services
* logs

## TASKS
* Refresh your list of available packages (apps) by: _sudo apt update_ - this takes a moment or two, but ensures that you'll be getting the latest versions. 
* Install Apache from the repository with a simple:  _sudo apt install apache2_
* Confirm that it’s running by browsing to _http://[external IP of your server]_  - where you should see a confirmation page. 
* Apache is installed as a "service" - a program that starts automatically when the server starts and keeps running whether anyone is logged in or not. Try stopping it with the command: *sudo systemctl stop apache2* - check that the webpage goes dead - then re-start it with *sudo systemctl start apache2* - and check its status with: *sudo systemctl status apache2*.
* As with the vast majority of Linux software, configuration is controlled by files under the _/etc_ directory - check the configuration files under */etc/apache2*  especially */etc/apache2/apache.conf* - you can use *less* to simply view them, or the *vim* editor to view and edit as you wish.
* Notice the directory */etc/apache2/conf.d* - the settings in the files in this folder are merged in with those from */etc/apache2/apache2.conf* at load. This approach of lots of small specific config files is common. The ".d" extension has no special meaning to the operating system, but is a common convention to denote a directory.
* If you're familiar with configuring web servers, then go crazy, setup some virtual hosts, or add in some mods etc.
* The location of the default webpage is defined by the *DocumentRoot* parameter in the file */etc/apache2/sites-available/default*.
* Use *less* or *vim* to view the code of the default page - normally at */var/www/index.html*. This uses fairly complex modern web design - so you might like to browse to http://178.128.120.26/sample where you'll see a much simpler page. Use View Source in your browser to see the code of this, copy it, and then, in your ssh session _sudo vim /var/www/html/index.html_ to first delete the existing content, then paste in this simple example - and then edit to your own taste. View the result with your workstation browser by again going to _http://[external IP of your server]_
* As with the vast majority of Linux software, Apache keeps its logs under the */var/log* directory - look at the logs in */var/log/apache2* - in the *access.log* file you should be able to see your session from when you browsed to the test page. Notice that there's an overwhelming amount of detail - this is typical, and later you'll see we'll see how to filter out what we want. Notice the *error.log* file too - hopefully this one will be empty!

## Posting your progress
Practice your text-editing skills, and allow your "classmates" to judge your progress by editing */var/www/index.html*  and posting the URL to access it to the forum. (It doesn’t have to be pretty!)

## Security
* As the sysadmin of this server, responsible for its security, you need to be very aware that you've now increased the "attack surface" of your server. In addition to *ssh* on port 22, you are now also exposing the *apache2* code on port 80. Over time the logs may reveal access from a wide range of visiting search engines, and attackers - and that’s perfectly normal.
* If you run the commands: *sudo apt update*, then *sudo apt upgrade*, and accept the suggested upgrades, then you'll have all the latest security updates, and be secure enough for a test environment - but you should re-run this regularly.
